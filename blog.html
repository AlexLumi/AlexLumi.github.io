	<h1> Week 1 </h1>

	<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the start of my internship at the University of Virginia, and the first week is about to conclude. In summary, I started by making phase boxes, which are archival boxes used to effectively and economically protect brittle or deteriorated volumes. When starting my boxes were not as tightly constructed as they should be, but with time, I ended up getting accumulated to doing them correctly. The secret to my improvement was that I needed to pay closer attention to how the board is lined up on the board shear because if not, it would end up slanted. Along with phase boxes, I had learned how to heat mend. Heat mending is a safer way better than regular tape, and it uses heat set paper and a tacking iron. I used my knowledge of heat mending on the blueprints that the University of Virginia had needed with my mentor/supervisor Sue. </p>
    &nbsp
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later in the week, I got to learn how to sew pamphlets, which is a simple way of binding folded pages, often as an alternative to stapling. I only made one of these, but if I ever made them again, I would probably pay attention to the length of the string and also the order in which they go into the holes. Moving forward, I was introduced into microfilm, which is a length of film containing microphotographs of a newspaper, catalog, or other document. By using  A-D stripes, you can see the deterioration of the film after it has been on it for 24 hours. I then took the strips out and documented the numerical value of how much it was deteriorating. I did this for every box in the drawer.</p>
    &nbsp
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, I visited Monticello, which was the primary plantation of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, who began designing and building Monticello at age 26 after inheriting land from his father. I got to see the inside of the main building/house and inside Martha Jefferson's home. I also got to see the archaeologist lab where they showed all the artifacts that they have found at different sites at Monticello. The University of Virginia also contributes to this artifact collection and preservation by scanning the objects and then 3-D printing them. I learned that the reason for this is because the boxes that contain the artifacts are not climate controlled so, therefore, most of the objects would start to rust.</p>

    <h1> Week 2 </h1>
	<h3> June 17, 2019 - June 21, 2019 </h3>
    <hr class ="hrblog">
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my second week in the internship, and I’m starting to get introduced more to new departments that are involved with preservation. For instance, I was introduced to the digital preservation group which utilizes high-end cameras that can range to 100 megapixels, capture one, and Photoshop to scan items for either requested usage or to put in an archive. They taught me about the quality assurance that they have to go through and how big of a deal it is to make sure that you are producing the very best quality for the customer or the school.</p>
    &nbsp
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with continuing with phases boxes, I was introduced to tuxedo boxes which provide protection from light and abrasion and are suitable for brittle materials or books with loose boards. On Wednesday of this week, I was given an introduction to Flowerdew which is a plantation of some 1,400 acres, that is situated along Virginia’s James River in Prince George County, and the property has operated as a historic site and museum. I was given a better understanding of the processes that they have to go through when finding certain artifacts like if it was from a Native American tribe or human remains. On the same day, I got to talk with Marc and Steven about what they do and how it relates to preservation in the library. I learned a lot about audio/visual media preservation methods and how complicated it was for me to absorb everything when it came to photo negatives and old film. However, I will say that it is a need for that type of work as we progress with more film and audio innovations.</p>
    &nbsp
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continuing, I got to learn about 3D printing and how it correlates to the library as this was the closest subject to my field of study. Lastly, I got to hear about the rebinding process with Ginny and instruction in special collections where both were very interesting.</p>
