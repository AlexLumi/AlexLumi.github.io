	<p> It is the start of my internship at the University of Virginia, and the first week is about to conclude. In summary, I started by making phase boxes, which are archival boxes used to effectively and economically protect brittle or deteriorated volumes. When starting my boxes were not as tightly constructed as they should be, but with time, I ended up getting accumulated to doing them correctly. The secret to my improvement was that I needed to pay closer attention to how the board is lined up on the board shear because if not, it would end up slanted. Along with phase boxes, I had learned how to heat mend. Heat mending is a safer way better than regular tape, and it uses heat set paper and a tacking iron. I used my knowledge of heat mending on the blueprints that the University of Virginia had needed with my mentor/supervisor Sue. </p>
    <p>Later in the week, I got to learn how to sew pamphlets which is a simple way of binding folded pages, often as an alternative to stapling. I only made one of these but if I ever made them again I would probably pay attention to the length of the string and also the order in which they go into the holes. Moving forward, I was introduced into microfilm which is a length of film containing microphotographs of a newspaper, catalog, or other document. By using  A-D stripes, you are able to see the deterioration of the film after it has been on it for 24 hours. I then took the strips out and documented the numerical value of how much it was deteriorating. I did this for every box in the drawer.  </p>
    <p>Lastly, I visited Monticello which was the primary plantation of Thomas Jefferson, the third President of the United States, who began designing and building Monticello at age 26 after inheriting land from his father. I got to see the inside of the main building/house and inside Martha Jefferson's home. I also got to see the archaeologist lab where they showed all the artifacts that they have found at different sites at Monticello. The University of Virginia also contributes to this artifact collection and preservation by scanning the objects and then 3-D printing them. I learned that the reason for this is because the boxes that contain the artifacts are not climate controlled so, therefore, most of the objects would start to rust.</p>
